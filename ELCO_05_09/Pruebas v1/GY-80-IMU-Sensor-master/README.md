# GY-80-IMU-Sensor
## A sensor library for all of the sensors on the GY-80.
This libary is in development and only has basic funtionality at the moment.  The eventual goal of the library is to be able to fully interact with all of the sensors on the GY-80.  An example file will also be added later.

# Setup
Simply clone this library to the arduino libraries folder:
```
	git clone https://github.com/Sanderi44/GY-80-IMU-Sensor.git
```
Restart Processing.  Then, include in your arduino sketch:
```
	#include <GY80.h>
```
